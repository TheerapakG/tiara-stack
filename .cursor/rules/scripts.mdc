There are two workspace-level scripts defined in package.json.
The "build" script invokes nx to build all the packages.
The "checks" script invokes nx to run linter, formatter, and type checkers in all the packages.
Run these scripts using `pnpm -w <script>`, replacing `<script>` with the script you want to run.
The lint tool call may be unreliable. You should run `pnpm -w checks` than using the lint tool call.
