description: Guidelines on Effect Library Usage in This Project
alwaysApply: true
---

This project utilizes the Effect library for composability and type-safety. The version of the library being used is 3.18.4. The project prefers using the "pipe" syntax (with "do simulation" to combat excessive nesting) over the "generator" syntax. Use Effect/Schema for runtime validation except existing code use other validation library, or otherwise stated.
